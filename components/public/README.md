# Public Components

This directory is reserved for all public-facing portfolio UI sections and shared display components.

Migration target examples:
- `Navbar`
- `Hero`
- `About`
- `Projects`
- `Experience`
- `Skills`
- `Contact`
- `Footer`

Current implementation still uses root-level `components/*` files and will be moved incrementally in later product-focused prompts.
